# Dividing Karel's World into Four Equal Chambers

## Introduction
This project provides a solution for dividing a given grid (Karel's world) into four equal chambers or the largest possible number of equal chambers if four is not feasible. The approach minimizes moves, reduces beeper usage, and keeps the code efficient.

## Problem Analysis
- The grid may have varying dimensions.
- If the grid can't be evenly divided into four chambers, the solution finds the largest possible number of equal chambers.
- Prioritizes using fewer beepers and minimal moves.

## Solution Approach
1. **Initialize Karel's Environment**: Set up Karel with an initial number of beepers.
2. **Find Grid Dimensions**: Use `findKarelWorldDimensions()` to determine the grid size.
3. **Divide the Grid**: Depending on the dimensions, divide it optimally using various strategies:
   - Square grids (even/odd dimensions) use diagonal or cross division.
   - Rectangular grids are handled with double lines of beepers.
   - Special cases use the `divideAsPatterns()` method for efficiency.

## Optimization Details
- **Minimized Moves**: Uses `moveToEnd` and `findKarelWorldDimensions` for efficiency.
- **Reusable Functions**: Avoids code duplication.
- **Efficient Beeper Usage**: Places beepers only where necessary.

## Conclusion
This solution provides an efficient way to divide Karelâ€™s world while minimizing resources and improving code reusability.
